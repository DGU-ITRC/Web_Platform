Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from 
Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an 
animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. 
In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they 
are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.” I 
pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a coloured 
pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: 
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. 
But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?” My drawing was not 
a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown- 
ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa 
constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. `;

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot air-planes. I have flown a little over all 
parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can 
distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. In the 
course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been 
concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen 
them intimately, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them. 
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of 
showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this 
was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: “That is a 
hat.” Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I 
would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and 
neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man. 
So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my 
plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had 
with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all 
alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a 
week. 
The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I 
was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can 
imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. 
It said: “If you please, draw me a sheep!” 
“What!” 
“Draw me a sheep!” `;

I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid 
known as B-612. This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a 
Turkish astronomer, in 1909. 
On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical 
Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe 
what he said. Grown-ups are like that... 
Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his 
subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer 
gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time 
everybody accepted his report. `;

The little prince went on with his explanation: “Your planet is so small that three strides will take 
you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. 
When you want to rest, you will walk and the day will last as long as you like.” 
“That doesn’t do me much good,” said the lamplighter. “The one thing I love in life is to sleep.” 
“Then you’re unlucky,” said the little prince. 
“I am unlucky,” said the lamplighter. “Good morning.” And he put out his lamp. 
“That man,” said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, “that man 
would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the 
businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. 
Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.” 
He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: “That man is the only one of them all 
whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for 
two people...” What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave 
this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets! 
The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who 
wrote voluminous books.
